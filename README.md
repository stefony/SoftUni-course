Problems for exercises with Arrays
1.	Day of Week
Enter a day number and print the day name  or "Invalid day!".
Array of strings holding the day names: {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"}.
2.	Print Numbers in Reverse Order
Read n numbers and print them in reverse order.
3.	Sum Even Numbers
Read an array from the console and sum only the even numbers.
4.	Reverse an Array of Strings
Write a program to read an array of strings, reverse it and print its elements. The input consists of a sequence of space-separated strings. Print the output on a single line (space separated).Read the array of strings.
5.	Even and Odd Subtraction
Write a program that calculates the difference between the sum of the even and the sum of the odd numbers in an array. First, we need to read the array. We will need two variables – even and odd sum. Iterate through all elements in the array. Check the current number – if it is even, adds it to the even sum, otherwise, add it to the odd sum. Print the difference.
6.	Equal Arrays
Read two arrays and print on the console whether they are identical or not. Arrays are identical if their elements are equal. If the arrays are identical, find the sum of the first one and print on the console the following message: "Arrays are identical. Sum: {sum}", otherwise find the first index where the arrays differ and print on the console following message: "Arrays are not identical. Found difference at {index} index."
7.	Condense Array to Number
Write a program to read an array of integers and condense them by summing adjacent couples of elements until a single integer is obtained. For example, if we have 3 elements {2, 10, 3}, we sum the first two and the second two elements and obtain {2+10, 10+3} = {12, 13}, then we sum again all adjacent elements and obtain {12+13} = {25}.
